- What is a Data Structure?  
- Key Features of Data Structures in Java  
- Types of Data Structures in Java  
- Singly Linked List  
- Doubly Linked List  
- Circular Linked List  

 Day 2: Stack, Queue, and HashMap

- Stack (LIFO)  
- Queue (FIFO)  
- HashMap and Hashing Function  

 Day 3: Sorting Algorithms

- Bubble Sort  
- Insertion Sort  
- Merge Sort  
- Quick Sort  

 Day 4: Searching and Java Utilities

- StringBuilder  
- StringBuffer  
- FileReader  
- InputStreamReader  
- Linear Search  
- Binary Search  

 Day 5: Runtime Analysis and Big-O Notation

1. What is Runtime Analysis?  
2. Understanding Big-O Notation  
3. Time Complexity Analysis  
4. Space Complexity Analysis  
5. Best, Worst, and Average Case Complexities  
6. Practical Guidelines for Optimizing Java Code
   
 Prerequisites

- Strong understanding of Java basics and OOP (Weeks 1 & 2)  
- JDK and a Java IDE (VS Code, Eclipse, or IntelliJ IDEA)  
- Familiarity with arrays and control flow  

 How to Use This Repository

The repository is organized by day. Each folder includes code examples, exercises, and notes for that day's topic. Run the code, trace its logic, and modify it to gain a deeper understanding of each data structure and algorithm.
